is a standard Gents slave clock movement which is advanced by a pulse every 30s, counted down from seconds pulses generated by the pendulum.", "Additional circuits in the clock once generated other

seconds.", "It is suspended from a bracket attached to a massive iron casting bolted through to the wall, which also carries the \u201cescapement\u201d mechanism to the right under the face.", "This drives the pendulum with a small impulse of force every second, generated by the drop of a small weight under the control of an electromagnet.", "Part of the mechanism includes a 60-tooth ratchet wheel advanced on every pendulum swing by a pawl driven by the electromagnet.", "Originally this operated a pair of contacts by two pins on its periphery to generate the half-minute pulses, but at some stage these contacts were removed.", "To the left of the pendulum is the regulator.", "This is arranged to apply a small force to the pendulum which through an ingenious linkage effectively works against gravity, slowing the pendulum down.", "The force comes from a torque generated by a spiral hair-spring, one end being attached to the pivot of a lever that forms part of the escapement linkage, the other to a disk that can be rotated in small steps by a solenoid-operated \u201cstepper motor\u201d.", "This allows the period of the pendulum to be adjusted by changing the torque, under the control of a system that compares the pendulum phase to a time standard (originally a daily pulse sent out over the telegraph network at 10.00 GMT).", "Behind the pendulum and near its top is a standard aneroid barometer, and below that a mercury thermometer.", "These would have been used when checking the clocks\u2019 rate, which depends on both atmospheric temperature and pressure.", "To the left of the pendulum is the Civil Time Unit (CTU).", "This is essentially a clock that receives a pulse every second from the pendulum and keeps track of local time, GMT or BST depending on the season, to control the pulses sent to Great George to make it chime on the hours, 0700 through 2100 except Sundays.", "The CTU was driven by its own electromagnet.", "On the right is the Greenwich Time Unit (GTU), which essentially kept GMT by counting seconds impulses but also controlled the sequencing of the synchronising system around 10.00 am GMT every day.", "Again, the GTU had its own electromagnet drive.", "Behind the wall to which the clock was mounted there was a Control Box that housed several terminal frames, some relays, and ancillary components, that were connected to contacts on the TUs by wires going through the wall.", "Most of this has now been lost.", "The clock and its circuits were power by a 24 volt lead-acid battery, possibly also housed in this room.",
